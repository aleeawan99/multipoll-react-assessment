# React Multipoll Assessment
*In this project, a React.js application was created using the Create React App (CRA) template. The app features a multi-step poll form, designed to mimic a specified layout, with a custom-built carousel instead of relying on third-party libraries. Each step in the form is configurable, including attributes like a title (displayed on a side panel) and options with icons and hover labels. A vertical carousel with corresponding animations, such as vertical slide-in effects, was implemented. The options are interactive, with labels appearing on hover and selections being highlighted and labeled upon clicking. The final step includes a summary slide that displays the selected answers, incorporating a reveal-left animation. The final data is submitted to a mock API, and unit tests are written for all components.*
